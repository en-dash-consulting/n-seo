Capture a requirement, feature idea, or task from conversation context.

1. If a description is provided, use it. Otherwise, review recent conversation for feature requests, requirements, or product decisions
2. Call `get_prd_status` (rex MCP) to understand current PRD structure
3. Determine the appropriate level:
   - Epic: large initiative spanning multiple features
   - Feature: a capability or user-facing behavior
   - Task: a concrete, implementable work item
4. Find the appropriate parent by matching to existing epics/features
5. Draft the item: title, description, acceptance criteria
6. Present to the user for confirmation before creating
7. Use `add_item` (rex MCP) to create, then confirm placement in hierarchy
8. Check for dependencies: does this item block or depend on other pending items? If so, set `blockedBy` via `edit_item` (rex MCP)
9. **Commit**: run `git status --porcelain` against the project root — this catches MCP side-effect writes (e.g. `add_item` and `edit_item` write to `.rex/prd_tree/<slug>/index.md`) even when no files were edited directly. If the output is empty, print "Working tree clean — nothing to commit." and stop. Otherwise stage all changes with `git add -A` and commit with the n-dx authorship + model audit trailer block via a HEREDOC:

   ```sh
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ndx-capture: add '<title>' to PRD

   N-DX: skill/ndx-capture
   Co-Authored-By: En Dash's n-dx <n-dx@endash.us>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

   Substitute `<title>` with the captured item title. Keep the `N-DX:` and `Co-Authored-By:` trailer lines exactly as shown — they form the audit trail used by downstream tooling.

## Always do these without being asked

- **Place under a parent** — never leave items at root level. Match to the closest existing epic/feature.
- **Set dependencies** — if multiple items are being captured, or if existing pending items have ordering relationships, wire `blockedBy` edges.
- **Set priority** — infer from context (urgency, blocking status, user language like "critical", "should", "nice to have").
